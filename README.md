# Overview

This is an app that was developed to be used in conjuction with a study of the bible while using a hebrew bible. I personally found that it was difficult to find a hebrew app that was really useful in the way that I wanted to use it, so I created one myself!

Here is a video demonstration:

# Development Environment

This app was programmed using React, and I used a Hebrew JSON dictionary from the Open Scriptures Project.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- The main thing is that I would like to add more features, and improve the search to find more specifically what you may be looking for. For example, typing in a strong's id should bring up the word with that ID first, and any other related words afterwards.
